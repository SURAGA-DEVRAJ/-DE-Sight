  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
  
  <p>In INDIA there are millions of deaf and hard of hearing people.considering the fact that a large number of them cannot afford the current solutions, I wanted to create a solution which would be effecient and cost effective.
  <p>This showed me the path to (DE)Sight an acronymm for DEAFNESS SIGHT -the power of  EYES TO HEAR</p>
  <p>I got an Idea of projecting words what others are talking into the glass screen of the user so that he could just read the words what others are talking ,just like watching movie subtitles , this could crossout the barrier of using sign language for deaf persons and others can interact with them just like any common persons</p>
  <p>the current possible available for this is hearing aid but many of them cannot use this solution as they may be suffering from complete deafness and hearing aid could not be any use for them , But desight has no such barrier people suffering from any type of deafness could use them</p>
  <p>So I designed a  pair of glasses which has a microphone which recieves the audio that can be paired with any device which has bluetooth conncetivity.the paired device for example a phone will receive the audio signal and convert it to text (voice recognition).This has been done so as to reduce the weight of the glasses.this can be employed while talking to other people and interact with them easily
  .</p>
  
  <p>Some of the other features in the proposed work that provide additional support to deaf people are as follows:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>it can display notificationsof various apps.</li>
  <li>recognising various announcements in public places like airport/railway station.</li>
  <li>Can watch movies with subtitles in theatres.</li>
  <li>If it can be developed into advance form we can use translate other languages into the language of their choice.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This section discusses the basic design of the  device. desight can be either started with switch or voice.</p>

  <p>This device provides assistance to a people who cant hear. The device is essentially ready for all the situations . Fig.1 shows the hardware design of the  device. Right now, the design comprises of a primary switch to activate the device.</p>

  <ol>
  <li>Power supply</li>
  <li>the bluetooth connected device converts the audio signal into subtitle file</li>
  <li>and the subtitle file is displayed on the lcd screen of the glasses</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  
  <p>this device helps people with hearing problem to not use any sign language to interact with others and ables them to interact with people easily and also make them feel as common people .This will even help children learn better , just like other kids and dont need special support by teachers on using sign language , this will even better their reading skills</p>
